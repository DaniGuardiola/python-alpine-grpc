# python-alpine-grpc

Alpine Linux with Python 3 and gRPC.

Based on the `python:3.7.2-alpine` docker image, compiles and installs the `grpc` and `grpc-tools` python packages from Pypi.

> **Important:** I'm not currently maintaining this Docker image, but feel free to send PRs for updates (for example, upgrading the Python version). I'll accept them if they're okay.
